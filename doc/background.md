### 1. What is CTF-D and the CTF challenge 

Capture The Flags, or CTFs, are a kind of computer security competition. Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skill. Normally there are 5 main types of challenge during the event:

- **Forensics**: challenges can include file format analysis such as: `steganography`, `memory dump analysis`, or `network packet capture analysis`.
- **Cryptography**: challenges includes how data is constructed such as: `XOR`, `Caesar Cipher`, `Substitution Cipher`, `Vigenere Cipher`, `Hashing Functions`, `Block Ciphers`, `Stream Ciphers`, `RSA`. 
- **Web Exploitation**: challenges  includes exploiting a bug to gain some kind of higher level privilege such as:  `SQL Injection`, `Command Injection`, `Directory Traversal`, `Cross Site Request Forgery`, `Cross Site Scripting`, `Server Side Request Forgery`. 
- **Reverse Engineering**: challenges includes  taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format such as : `Assembly / Machine Code`, `The C Programming Language`, `Disassemblers`, `Decompilers`. 
- **Binary Exploitation**:  broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions such as: `Registers`, `The Stack`, `Calling Conventions` ,`Global Offset Table (GOT)`, `Buffers`, `Buffer Overflow`, `Return Oriented Programming (ROP)`, `Binary Security`,  `No eXecute (NX)`, `Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)`, `Stack Canaries`, `Relocation Read-Only (RELRO)`, `The Heap`, `Heap Exploitation`, `Format String Vulnerability`.
