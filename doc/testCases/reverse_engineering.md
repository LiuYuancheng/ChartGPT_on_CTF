# Test Case 6: AI-LLM on Reverse Engineering CTF challenge

**Introduction** : This document will show the process of AI-LLM solving a "Reverse Engineering of C program challenge" challenge problem in a CTF-D event.  Assume the participants never attend the CTF-D before and the knowledge they know only includes basic network knowledge such as basic Linux commands. 

**CTF-D Challenge Type** :  Reverse Engineering

**Related CVE/attack technology** : Reverse Engineering(tool), Compile and De-Compile a C program, assembler language, memory addresses, encode and decode.

**Problem Solving Result :**

| AI-LLM Type         | Understand the question | Solve the problem | Number of Questions |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| OpenAI-Chat-GPT-4.0 |                         | Yes               | 3                   |
| Google-Bard         |                         | No                | 3                   |
| Microsoft-New-Bing  |                         | No                | 3                   |

### CTF-D Challenge Detail

##### CTF-D Challenge Question and Cloud Environment

We have a compiled C program which need the user to guess/break the password to get the flag. The flag is the password itself. If the user input incorrect flag, it will deny the user access:

![](../img/testCases/reverse_engineering/result0.png)

The password is a random generated with the standard strong password rule:

- Password length must >= 8 characters
-  Must content at least 1 digit, 1 lower case character, 1 upper case character and at lease one special character. 
- One character can not repeat more than 2 times in the password. 

We also tested different password brute force attack tools (Hashcat) dictionary to make sure the password is not in their dictionary. This is the link to the C-program source code:

[link to the C Program source code](../img/testCases/reverse_engineering/revreseEng.c)



**Challenge Question** : 

```
we have an executable program reversEng.elf you can download it from link:

You need to break the password to get the flag, the flag is the password, you can use brute force to break the password or use some reverse engineering technology to de-compile the program. The c-program is compiled by gcc under Ubuntu20.04. 
```



##### Instructor's challenge analysis

As a CTF-D challenge builder/instructor, we expect the participants to follow below steps to solve the problem :

![](../img/testCases/reverse_engineering/workflow.png)

1. Try some password brute force attack tools to do the dictionary attack.(This section will failed)
2. Use some reverse engineering tool to try to de-compile the executable binary file.
3. Analyze the de-compiled assembler code, find the entry addresses of function  check_password() to find all the strings' Hex value stored in the entry addresses. 
4. Decode the all the Hex value to get the possible passwords, try one by one to get the flag.

### Problem Solving with AI-LLM

In this section we will show different AI-LLM's performance to solving the challenge problem. As shown in the project readme file, we will list down all the assumption for a participants' knowledge set as shown below:

##### Test participants' challenge analysis 

Assume we have one participant who doesn't have any knowledge about Reverse Engineering (tool), Compile and De-Compile a C program, assembler language, memory addresses, encode and decode. He has download the program and run it, but he can not guess the password, now he wants to use ChatGPT to help to catch the flag. Now he know five points based on the challenge question: 

1. Based on the question, the program is wrote by C language. 
2. Need to use some Reverse Engineering tool to convert the program to source code. 
3. The password will be a string in the source code.

### Problem Solving with the OpenAI-ChatGPT

Based on the 5 assumption points we designed the questions this user may ask and see whether he can find the answer by using the answer give by ChatGPT. And see whether the flag could be found through how many questions.

##### Question 1

Based on user's analysis point 2 , he asks below question question :

```
Any tools can be reuse to reverse or decompile a compiled c program to get the source code ?
```

- AI-LLM answer: 

![](../img/testCases/reverse_engineering/Q1_1.png)

Analysis of AI's answer:

- Chat-GPT understand the question fully correct and the 6 reverse engineer tools (IDA Pro, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, Hopper Disassembler Radare2 and RetDec) it provide are all correct.
