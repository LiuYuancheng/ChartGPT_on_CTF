Question:In cryptanalysis and computer security, pass the hash is a hacking technique that allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server/service by using the underlying NTLM and/or LanMan hash of a users password, instead of requiring the associated plaintext password as is normally the case. Metasploit Framework has a module for this technique: psexec. The psexec module is often used by penetration testers to obtain access to a given system whose credentials are known. It was written by sysinternals and has been integrated within the framework. The penetration testers successfully gain access to a system through some exploit, use meterpreter to grab the passwords or other methods like fgdump, pwdump, or cachedump and then utilize rainbowtables to crack those hash values. Which of the following is true hash type and sort order that is used in the psexec modules smbpass option?
A. LM:NT
B. NTLM:LM
C. NT:LM
D. LM:NTLM

Bob, a system administrator at TPNQM SA, concluded one day that a DMZ is not needed if he properly configures the firewall to allow access just to servers/ports, which can have direct internet access, and block the access to workstations.

A. Bob can be right since DMZ does not make sense when combined with stateless firewalls
B. Bob is partially right. He does not need to separate networks if he can create rules by destination IPs, one by one
C. Bob is totally wrong. DMZ is always relevant when the company has internet servers and workstations
D. Bob is partially right. DMZ does not make sense when a stateless firewall is available
