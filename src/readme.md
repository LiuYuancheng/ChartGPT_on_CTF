# Apply OpenAI api on CTF cyber security multi-choice questions

**Program design** :  we want to create a tools set which can automatically scan different kinds of CTF questions, pass the question or challenge to AI/AI-LLM to get the solution,  then count the AI's answer correctness rate. 

[TOC]



#### Tool 1: Multi choice CTF question tester

This tool is use to test the  test the OpenAI's question solving correctness rate of the normal multiple choice cyber-security question which may appear in the CTF event.

**Question example** :

```
Question:Which configuration implements an ingress traffic filter on a dual-stack ISR border router to prevent attacks from the outside to services such as DNSv6 and
DHCPv6?
A. ! ipv6 access-list test deny ipv6 FF05::/16 any deny ipv6 any FF05::/16 ! output omitted permit ipv6 any any !
B. ! ipv6 access-list test permit ipv6 any FF05::/16 ! output omitted deny ipv6 any any !
C. ! ipv6 access-list test deny ipv6 any any eq dns deny ipv6 any any eq dhcp ! output omitted permit ipv6 any any !
D. ! ipv6 access-list test deny ipv6 any 2000::/3 ! output omitted permit ipv6 any any !
E. ! ipv6 access-list test deny ipv6 any FE80::/10 ! output omitted permit ipv6 any any
Answer:A
```



**Basic rule of Identify AI's answer is incorrect**: 

1. AI choose the incorrect answer. 
2. AI can not understand the question. 
3. Example of multi selection : correct answer is 'A', AI thinks 'A' or 'B' both correct, then identify AI's answer incorrect.  
4. Example of multi selection : correct answer is 'A and B',  AI only answered 'A' is correct, then identify AI's answer incorrect.
