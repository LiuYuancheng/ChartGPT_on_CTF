The factors of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity are considered as fundamentals because they play a crucial role in understanding security and its components. 

Confidentiality ensures that information is only accessible to authorized individuals, protecting it from unauthorized disclosure. 

Integrity ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered, preventing unauthorized modification or tampering. 

Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible and usable when needed, preventing any disruptions or denial of service. 

Authenticity ensures that the identity of individuals or entities involved in a communication or transaction can be verified, preventing impersonation or fraud. 

Understanding these factors helps in understanding the hacking process, as hackers often exploit vulnerabilities related to confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity. Additionally, these factors are also the main elements for any security breach, as a breach often involves a compromise in one or more of these areas.
