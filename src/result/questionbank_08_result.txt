2023-07-31 13:21:37,348 INFO     Question 17: incorrect. correct answer: B, AI answer: The recommended architecture in terms of server placement for deploying a new web-based software package for an organization is option B: A web server facing the Internet, an application server on the internal network, and a database server on the internal network.

This architecture follows the principle of separating the different components of the software package for security and scalability purposes. The web server, which handles the incoming requests from the Internet, should be placed in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) to provide a layer of protection between the Internet and the internal network.

The application server, which processes the business logic and handles the application's functionality, should be placed on the internal network. This ensures that the sensitive application code and data are not directly exposed to the Internet.

The database server, which stores and manages the application's data, should also be placed on the internal network. This provides an additional layer of security and control over the data, as it is not directly accessible from the Internet.

By separating the servers and placing them in different network zones, organizations can better control access, secure sensitive data, and scale their infrastructure as needed.
2023-07-31 13:21:41,803 INFO     Question 18: incorrect. correct answer: D, AI answer: C. The ACL for FTP must be before the ACL 110.

The current configuration is denying all traffic by default because there is no explicit permit statement. The ACL 110 is currently placed before the ACL for FTP, which means that it is denying all traffic, including FTP traffic, before it can reach the FTP ACL. 

To fix this issue, the ACL for FTP should be placed before ACL 110 so that FTP traffic can be permitted before it is denied by ACL 110.
