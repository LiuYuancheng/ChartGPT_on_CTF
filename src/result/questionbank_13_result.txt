2023-07-31 14:41:19,784 INFO     Question 43: incorrect. correct answer: D, AI answer: To calculate the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), we multiply the cost of a single loss event by the exposure factor (EF). In this case, the cost of a single loss event is the cost to buy a new hard drive, which is $300. The EF is given as 1 (100%), so the SLE is:

SLE = $300 * 1 = $300

The Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is the number of times the loss event occurs in a year. In this case, the hard drive failure occurs once every three years, so the ARO is:

ARO = 1 / 3 = 0.33

The Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the expected cost of the loss event per year. It is calculated by multiplying the SLE by the ARO. In this case, the ALE is:

ALE = $300 * 0.33 = $99

The closest approximate cost of this replacement and recovery operation per year is $99. Therefore, the correct answer is C. $100.
