2023-07-31 15:11:45,134 INFO     Question 5: incorrect. correct answer: C, AI answer: The subnet 10.1.4.0/23 has a range of IP addresses from 10.1.4.1 to 10.1.5.254. 

To lease the last 100 usable IP addresses, we need to exclude the first 154 IP addresses (10.1.4.1 to 10.1.4.154) and the broadcast address (10.1.5.255). 

Therefore, the IP addresses that could be leased as a result of the new configuration are:

- 10.1.4.155 to 10.1.5.254

Out of the given options, the only IP address that falls within this range is D. 10.1.4.156.

2023-07-31 15:12:06,851 INFO     Question 14: incorrect. correct answer: B, AI answer: To XOR the binary values 10110001 and 00111010, we perform the XOR operation on each corresponding bit:

1 XOR 0 = 1
0 XOR 0 = 0
1 XOR 1 = 0
1 XOR 1 = 0
0 XOR 1 = 1
0 XOR 0 = 0
0 XOR 1 = 1
0 XOR 0 = 0

Therefore, the result of XORing the binary values 10110001 and 00111010 is 10011101.

So, the correct answer is A. 10011101.

2023-07-31 15:12:42,312 INFO     Question 30: incorrect. correct answer: A, AI answer: C. Mitigate the risk

Mitigating the risk would involve implementing additional controls to further reduce the risk from 10% to below the risk threshold of 20%. This decision would be the best for the project in terms of its successful continuation with the most business profit because it allows the project to proceed while still maintaining an acceptable level of risk. Accepting the risk would leave the project vulnerable to a breach, which could result in financial loss and damage to the company's reputation. Introducing more controls to bring the risk to 0% may not be feasible or cost-effective, and avoiding the risk would likely require abandoning the project altogether.
