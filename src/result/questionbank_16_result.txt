2023-08-04 15:12:48,773 INFO     Question 31: incorrect. correct answer: BE, AI answer: The correct answers are:

A. The configuration will be updated with MAC addresses from traffic seen ingressing the port. The configuration will automatically be saved to NVRAM if no other changes to the configuration have been made.

B. The configuration will be updated with MAC addresses from traffic seen ingressing the port. The configuration will not automatically be saved to NVRAM.

Explanation:

The switchport port-security mac-address sticky command allows the switch to dynamically learn and store MAC addresses from the traffic seen ingressing the port. This means that the switch will automatically update its configuration with the learned MAC addresses.

However, the configuration will not automatically be saved to NVRAM. The administrator must manually save the configuration if they want to ensure that the learned MAC addresses are retained after a reboot or power cycle.

Therefore, options A and B are the correct considerations when using the switchport port-security mac-address sticky command.

2023-08-04 15:18:56,797 INFO     Question 53: incorrect. correct answer: CE, AI answer: The correct answers are A. rogue DHCP servers and D. MAC spoofing. 

The switchport port-security maximum command allows you to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a switchport. This helps to prevent rogue DHCP servers from being connected to the network, as well as mitigating MAC spoofing attacks where an attacker tries to impersonate a legitimate device by using its MAC address. 

ARP attacks, DHCP starvation, CAM attacks, and IP spoofing are not directly mitigated by the switchport port-security maximum command.
