2023-08-04 15:42:59,689 INFO     Question 4: incorrect. correct answer: A, AI answer: The most likely cause of the problem is option E. Client root certificate is not included in the Certificate Store. If the client root certificate is not included in the Certificate Store, the ISE server will not be able to validate the client's certificate during the authentication process, resulting in an EAP failure.

2023-08-04 15:43:55,659 INFO     Question 18: incorrect. correct answer: ABC, AI answer: The correct answers are B. Passes credentials to authentication server, C. Enforces policy provided by authentication server, and F. Validates authentication credentials. 

A network access device, such as a switch or wireless access point, plays a crucial role in the 802.1X authorization process. It acts as an intermediary between the supplicant (client device) and the authentication server. 

B. Passes credentials to authentication server: The network access device forwards the credentials provided by the supplicant to the authentication server for verification. 

C. Enforces policy provided by authentication server: Once the authentication server verifies the credentials, it provides the network access device with the appropriate policy for the supplicant. The network access device enforces this policy, which may include granting or denying access to specific resources or services. 

F. Validates authentication credentials: The network access device validates the authentication credentials provided by the supplicant before passing them to the authentication server. This helps ensure that only valid credentials are sent for verification. 

The other options (A, D, and E) are not functions typically performed by a network access device in the 802.1X authorization process.
